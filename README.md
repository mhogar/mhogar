Armed with a Bachelor of Computing, and pursing a Masters in Cybersecurity, I have a passion for programming and expressing myself creatively. I create a verity of open source projects, so be sure to check them out!

Check out my [Project Portfolio](https://mhogar.dev/portfolio) for a list of what I've created, and my [Personal Roadmap](https://github.com/mhogar/mhogar/projects/1) to see what things I have in the pipeline.
